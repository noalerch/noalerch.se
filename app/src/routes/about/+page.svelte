<p>Interests: music, IT, history, vegetarian and vegan cooking, laughing (getting really creative here), movies, science</p>

<p>Favorite music genres: hip hop, dance pop, rock, reggae, punk, metal,
 jazz, folk, electronic (particularly synthwave). And yes it is not lost on me that most of these genre names are very general and vague lol</p>
